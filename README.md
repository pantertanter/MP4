# MINI PROJECT 4: MACHINE LEARNING FOR ANALYSIS AND PREDICTION OF ATTRITION

## Objective
The objective of this mini project is to enable practice in data analysis and prediction by classification and clustering algorithms.

## Problem Statement
Attrition is the rate at which employees leave their job. When attrition reaches high levels, it becomes a concern for the company. Therefore, it is important to find out why employees leave, which factors contribute to such significant decisions. These and other related questions can be answered by exploration analysis and machine learning from the (synthetic) data provided by IBM to Kaggle.

## Tasks
1. **Data Wrangling and Exploration**
   - Load and explore the data, clean it, and analyze it by statistics.
   - Select the most relevant features of an employee for machine learning operations on prediction of the attrition.

   - We were in a hurry because our organization when wrong. So this means we will not have time to do the whole thing correct and you will se this as you scroll down.

   - We sorted out all non nomerical columns except the Attition column. Here we mapped 0 for No and 1 for Yes.

2. **Supervised Machine Learning: Classification**
   - Train, test, and validate two machine learning models for classification and prediction of attrition (e.g., Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes).
   
   - Apply appropriate methods and measures for assessing the validity of the models and recommend the one with the highest accuracy.

   - Done and they showed up equally good for our data set.

3. **Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering**
   - Apply at least one clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means) for segmentation of the employees into groups of similarity.

   - We applied K-mean but right here at the end of the project it failed and i can not fix it, as time is running out. Again we are sorry for the confusion.

   - Evaluate the quality of the clustering by calculating a silhouette score and recommend the cluster configuration with a higher score.

   - As one whole column has only two possible values 0 or 1, we feel like this might have contributed to the best silhuette score being twwo clusters with a value just a little over 5.1

4. **Machine Learning Application**
   - Create and deploy on the localhost an interactive prototype of Streamlit application, visualizing stages and results of your work.
   - Enable input of user data and making predictions on attrition by use of the classification model created in p.2 above.
   - Test the application with various previously unknown input data and record the results.

   -We have tried our best to make this happen, but really time is just running out and we need to deliver something.

## Notes
Feel free to replace the original dataset with another one, in support of your exam project if it is an appropriate source of classification and clustering. In that case, you need to formulate alternative questions for answering.
Submit a link to the Github repository of your solution, where in the readme file provide answers to the following questions:
- Which machine learning methods did you choose to apply in the application?

- Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes

- How accurate is your solution of prediction?

- The accuracy of both the Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes models is 1.0, indicating that both models achieved perfect accuracy on the test data. The precision, recall, and F1-score for both models are also perfect, with values of 1.00 for all metrics.

- Which are the most decisive factors for quitting a job?

- Which work positions and departments are at higher risk of losing employees?

- Are employees of different genders paid equally in all departments?

- Do family status and the distance from work influence work-life balance?

- Does education make people happy (satisfied with the work)?

- What were the challenges in the project development?

- We were too unorganized and had high expectations but in the end the result is not what we would have liked it to be.
It is not the assignments fault and we have learned a lot from it.

**Have success and fun!**
